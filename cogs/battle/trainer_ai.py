    Attacking: scores every move in its active Pokemon's move pool by
    accuracy-weighted expected damage (STAB, type effectiveness, and
    effective stats all factored in via estimate_damage), skips any move
    with no PP left, and attacks with the best one - or Struggles (index
    -1) if every move is out of PP.

    Priority is factored into two decision points, not just raw damage:
      • If any available move can KO the foe's current active outright,
        the bot doesn't just grab whichever such move scores highest on
        paper - among the moves that would actually KO, it prefers one
        that's guaranteed to go first (_acts_first: priority bracket beats
        Speed, same as the real turn order). A slower Pokemon's biggest
        hit is worthless if it faints before landing it - Golisopod
        packing Aqua Jet should use that to finish a faster Moltres
        instead of a stronger move that never gets to fire.
      • If the foe's predicted move would win the overall trade against
        our current pick - including the classic "both survive one hit,
        but whoever attacks first lands the finishing blow one hit sooner"
        case, not just an immediate one-turn faint - the bot falls back to
        its best move that DOES win that trade (_survives_trade),
        typically a priority move, rather than a bigger hit that loses a
        war of attrition it was actually able to win.
    Either way, this never overrides taking a guaranteed kill - going for
    the KO always beats "best raw score" once one is on the table.

    Switching: since the bot can see the opponent's entire moveset, it
    doesn't just compare "my best move vs their best move" - it works out
    the single heaviest hit the foe could land with ANY of its known moves
    (_worst_case_fraction) against both the Pokemon currently in and every
    bench candidate. A bench mon is only considered a real switch-in if:

      • it can survive that worst-case hit AND has a move strong enough to
        threaten a kill back (>= SWITCH_KILL_THRESHOLD of the foe's max
        HP) - "resists it" alone isn't enough, it has to be able to punish
        the foe too; or
      • it's faster than the foe's active AND still clears that same kill
        threshold - being faster only matters if it can also do something
        with the extra turn, not just stall.

    Among eligible candidates the AI picks whichever trades best (highest
    offense minus the risk of the hit it'd still take back), so a slower
    Pokemon that would just eat a huge hit and do nothing back is never
    sent in, even if it's the "type-neutral" pick. This is on top of the
    forced switches on faint handled by Battle.get_forced_switch."""
